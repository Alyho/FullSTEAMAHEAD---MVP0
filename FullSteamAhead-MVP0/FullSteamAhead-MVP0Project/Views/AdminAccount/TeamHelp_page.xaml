For the public members that you see, you can click on their team profile and invite them to join your team. This will bring you to your email where the recipient, subject, and body of the email is already filled out. If you want to add additional information, feel free to do so. Otherwise, send the email. This lets the user know directly that you are interested in them. The user can then choose to accept or decline. You will receive an email knowing their response.
