To first create a team, one admin must do so. They will also create a team password. When others wish to become admins of the same team, they will have to input the same credentials as the preexisting team that has already been created. The team nickname, username, and password must be the same. After that, the admin will be added to the team. Between each team admin of the team lie the same capabilities. If one team admin adds a notification or changes the information of their team, it will carry over to the other team admins. " />

                    <Label FontSize="20" Text="Full STEAM Ahead is designed to better organize and promote STEAM teams. Very often, there are students who are interested in joining STEAM teams, but due to their location, opportunities, and other factors, they are unable to find a team suitable for them. Similarly, there are many teams that want to expand themselves and reach more individuals. Full STEAM Ahead is a platform for teams and members to create an account in order to search for members or teams accordingly. Once members are in a team, the app provides many features that help organize the team, allowing members and admins to all communicate with each other and be prepared for future plans. With an app, hopefully teams and members can have a greater reach to explore everything within a device. " />
